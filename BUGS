meh does not currently support display depths under 24 bits. This should be
fixed in the next release.

Some WM's, though very few, allow meh's window to be resized to a width of 0.
meh is likely to crash in this case. A workaround will be found for the next
release.

Bugs may be sent to jhawthor@uvic.ca and are greatly appreciated.
